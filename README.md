A first-year tech enthusiast at NIIT University, I transform code into solutions. While others explore options, I'm already immersed in Web3 and Blockchain – because the future is 3.0, not 2.0.
With Python as my foundation and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in my toolkit, I'm currently conquering React. When not pushing commits to GitHub, I'm preparing for Google Summer of Code, believing vacations are best spent coding.

My mission is clear: become the standout tech innovator at my college, then replicate that success in my future organization. 

Think of me as a knowledge sponge, but with optimized learning algorithms. I bring both initiative and follow-through to every project, backed by an ambition that keeps my to-learn list growing longer than my course syllabus. 

Well-mannered yet determined, I'm not just dreaming about making an impact in tech – I'm coding my way there, one commit at a time.
