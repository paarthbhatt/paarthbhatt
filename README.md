# Hi there, I'm Parth Bhatt! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little about me:

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new and creative methods of problem-solving.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Science Engineering** at **NIIT University**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on diverse projects and assignments.
- 📫 Reach me at: 
  - **Phone**: +91 8920948990  
  - **Email**: [paarthbhatt37@gmail.com](mailto:paarthbhatt37@gmail.com)

## 🚀 My Journey

I'm a **first-year tech enthusiast** who believes in transforming code into impactful solutions. While many are exploring options, I’ve already dived into **Web3** and **Blockchain**, because the future is **3.0**, not **2.0**.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++ (starting DSA) and React (currently conquering!).
- **Current Mission**: Preparing for **Google Summer of Code**, because I believe vacations are best spent coding.

When I'm not pushing commits to GitHub, you'll find me optimizing my learning, contributing to open-source, and planning my next project.

## 🧑‍🎓 My Vision

- **Short-Term**: Become the standout tech innovator at my college.
- **Long-Term**: Bring the same success to my future organization.

I think of myself as a knowledge sponge with optimized learning algorithms. I approach every project with both initiative and follow-through, driven by an ambition that keeps my "to-learn" list growing longer than my syllabus.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- I’m **well-mannered yet determined**, combining humility with grit.
- Coding isn't just my passion – it's my way of creating impact, one commit at a time.

Feel free to explore my repositories and join me in my journey to shape the future of technology. Let’s build something amazing together!
